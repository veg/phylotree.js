Web application
  A web application for visualizing and annotating phylogenetic trees. Load trees as files or text, make multiple
  named selections with a variety of mechanisms, and save annotated trees for further use.

Ancestral sequence structural viewer
  Interfacing with `PV, the Javascript protein viewer <https://biasmv.github.io/pv/>`_, to visualize
  ancestral substitutions on a protein structure. `HyPhy`_ was used to infer ancestral substitutions on an alignment of hemagglutinin.
  Users can make two types of branch selections. Any branch that is selected and has inferred non-synonymous substitutions will
  instantaneously highlight positions where those substitutions occurred on an associated protein structure.

Interactive tanglegram
  A tanglegram to compare phylogenies inferred from muliple vs. single tissue samples. Crossings are minimized using a 
  dynamic programming algorithm, and the single-tissue tree enables selections to highlight inter-tree crossings.
